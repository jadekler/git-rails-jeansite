#### Hobbies
I love adventure! Whether that is travelling to new countries, or hiking in the Rockies, sky diving or bungie jumping, snowboarding or white water rafting - I'm up for it! I love spending time in nature, so whenever I can I try to find things to do outdoors: hiking, camping, and kayaking are my staple weekend adventure.

As much as I enjoy spending time outside adventuring, I must admit that I'm also a huge book nerd. [I love to read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21107993-jean-de-klerk)! I'm also a pretty big PC games nerd (thanks dad).

#### Personal Life
I was born and raised in South Africa, but moved at the age of 8 to England and later Sweden where I lived until I was 13. Following that, I spent another year in South Africa, after which I moved to Raleigh, NC USA. I graduated with Honors from highschool, and went on to study Computer Science as my major and Theoretical Math as my minor at North Carolina State University. I graduated Cum Laude from both studies in 2013."
